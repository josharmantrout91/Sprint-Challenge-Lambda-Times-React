1. What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript.

PropTypes are used to streamline error checking, and to help developers know at a glance the type of any specific property passed down into a child element without having to retrace the data path.

2. Describe a life - cycle event in React ?

The 3 major life - cycle events in React are Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.They all have to do with what's happening with our data- building from the ground up in Mounting, rendering and re-rendering based on triggers in Updating, and being removed from the screen in Unmounting.

3. Explain the details of a Higher Order Component ?

An HOC is a Component that accepts two child components and will interact with them both in a meaningful way.Two common use cases are to apply styling to two components simultaneously or to set a conditional rendering that toggles between rendering the two passed in components.

4. What are three different ways to style components in React ? Explain some of the benefits of each.

Vanilla CSS - the biggest advantage is likely going to be familiarity, the ability to get hyper - nuanced in the way that styling differs from one element to the next.

LESS / SASS - Borrows many of the same benefits from Vanilla CSS, albeit in a more streamlined fashion that nests for easier reading / more efficient webkitConvertPointFromPageToNode

Styled Components - this allows developers to do everything they want to do in JS between using JSX to render HTML elements and Styled Components to render CSS elements.Styled Components also allow for styling to utilize props.
